# Verification — <id>

[Story](../stories.md) · [Plan](../plans/<id>.md)

The link line under the title is part of this template: it is copied with it, never edited after the copy, and is not one of the implementer's lines.

The implementer writes this file before its final runs, then edits only `Tree:`, the `## Checks` table, "Not proven here" and the status line. `po-run` writes the `## Runs` section, one row per launch; no one else touches it. The gate compares the tree of each run with `Tree:` outside `docs/`: a declared check counts only through its runs on that code, and the last of them must have exited 0. Commands are copied exactly from `AGENTS.local.md`.

Order that produces `Tree:` — `git add -A`, then `git write-tree`. The hash therefore names the exact code the checks ran on. This file and the plan's ticks live inside `docs/`, which the comparison leaves out.

Tree: <hash printed by git write-tree>

## Checks
| Check | Command | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit suite | `<Test>` | |
| Type check | `<Typecheck>` | |
| End to end | — | deferred to ship |
| Build | — | deferred to ship |

A row with a command is a check you launch through `po-run`. A check not run at this stage, or one the project does not have, gets `—` as its command and says why in Note ("no such command in this project", "deferred to ship").

## Not proven here
<What this record does not cover, and which stage covers it — usually end-to-end and build at ship, lint and formatting at commit. Leaving this empty means claiming everything was checked.>

Verification status: <complete | incomplete>

## Runs
Written by `po-run`, one row per launch. Never edit, reorder or delete a row.

| Check | Command | Exit | Tree | Time (UTC) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
